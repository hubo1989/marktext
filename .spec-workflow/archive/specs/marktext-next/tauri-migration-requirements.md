## Constraints and Assumptions

### Technical Constraints
1. **Rust Learning Curve**: Development team needs Rust training
2. **API Differences**: Tauri APIs differ from Electron APIs
3. **Plugin Ecosystem**: Some Electron plugins may not have Tauri equivalents
4. **Build System**: Vite integration may require adjustments

### Business Constraints
1. **Timeline**: Migration should be completed within 3 months
2. **Resources**: Limited Rust development experience in team
3. **Risk Tolerance**: Low tolerance for functionality regression
4. **User Impact**: Zero downtime for existing users during transition

### Assumptions
1. **Team Skills**: Frontend team can learn basic Rust within 2 weeks
2. **Plugin Compatibility**: Critical Electron plugins have Tauri alternatives
3. **User Base**: Users will accept temporary performance during transition
4. **Testing Resources**: Sufficient QA resources for comprehensive testing

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Items
1. **API Translation Complexity**: Complex Electron APIs may be difficult to translate
2. **Plugin Compatibility**: Some functionality may require custom Tauri plugins
3. **Performance Regression**: Initial Tauri version may have performance issues
4. **Security Vulnerabilities**: Rust code may introduce security issues if not properly audited

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Incremental Migration**: Migrate functionality in small, testable chunks
2. **Parallel Development**: Maintain Electron version during Tauri development
3. **Comprehensive Testing**: Extensive automated and manual testing
