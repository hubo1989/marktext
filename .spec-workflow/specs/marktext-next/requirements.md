- ✅ Full width utilization without gaps or borders
- ✅ No unnecessary scrollbars
- ✅ Minimal button styling
- ✅ Responsive to sidebar toggle

### Requirement 3: Real-Time Synchronization

#### Description
Implement bidirectional real-time synchronization between source code and preview panels in dual-screen mode.

#### Functional Requirements
3.1 **Source to Preview Sync**
   - Real-time preview updates as user types in source panel
   - Support for all Markdown syntax rendering
   - Efficient rendering without performance degradation

3.2 **Preview to Source Sync**
   - Allow editing in preview panel with automatic source updates
   - Maintain cursor position and selection
   - Preserve formatting and structure

3.3 **Synchronization Quality**
   - Minimal latency between panels
   - Accurate rendering of all Markdown elements
   - Error handling for invalid syntax

#### Acceptance Criteria
- ✅ Source input immediately reflects in preview
- ✅ Preview edits update source code in real-time
- ✅ All Markdown syntax properly synchronized
- ✅ No performance degradation during editing

### Requirement 4: Export Functionality Enhancement

#### Description
Add Confluence and WeChat Official Account export options to the File menu with preview capabilities and clipboard integration.

#### Functional Requirements
4.1 **Confluence Export**
